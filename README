This is a RST C++11 library.

It is licensed under the Simplified BSD License.

Now the library contains the following components:

1. Option
  A lightweight analogy of Boost.optional and Option enum in Rust.
  It is used to support one more optional value for every existing type.
  It uses pointer-like semantics by overloading operator* and operator->.
  The object of the class asserts if it has been checked.

2. Result
  An analogy of Result enum in Rust. Also it is similar to Go's
  (value, error) return semantics.
  It is used as a return value of any method or function.
  The component can be helpful to support error handling without C++ exceptions.
  It uses pointer-like semantics by overloading operator* and operator->.
  A Result template class supports:
    * Result<ValueType, ErrorType>;
    * Result<void, ErrorType> - doesn't have '*' and '->' operator overloads.
  The object of the class asserts if it has been checked. So, it's impossible
 now to ignore an error.

3. Logger
  A fast flexible thread-safe Logger component for C++11.

4. Status
  A Google-like Status class for error handling with small improvements. It's
  impossible now to ignore an error.
