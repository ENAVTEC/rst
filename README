This is a RST C++11 library.

It is licensed under the Simplified BSD Licence.

Now the library contains the following components:

1. Option
  A lightweight analogy of Boost.optional and Option enum in Rust.
  It is used to support one more optional value for every existing type.

2. Result
  An analogy of Result enum in Rust. Also it is similar to Go's
  (value, error) return semantics.
  It is used as a return value of any method or function.
  The component can be helpful to support error handling without C++ exceptions.
